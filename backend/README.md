# Backend - Trivia API

## Setting up the Backend

### Install Dependencies

1. The solution was written and tested with Python 3.9.7 Anaconda distribution

2. **Virtual Environment** - We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organized. Instructions for setting up a virual environment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

3. **PIP Dependencies** - Once your virtual environment is setup and running, install the required dependencies by navigating to the `/backend` directory and running:
pip install -r requirements.txt

#### Key Pip Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use to handle the lightweight SQL database. You'll primarily work in `app.py` and can reference `models.py`.

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross-origin requests from our frontend server.

### Set up the Database

The project uses 2 separated databases: for a production environment and for the tests environment. In both cases, the solution is prepared to work with postgres sql.

**1. Production Environment**

  * **Connection parameters.** 

    Default values: 
    *  *host = `localhost`*,
    * *port = 5432*, 
    * *database name = `trivia_app`*.
     
  	Username and password are not setup. To set it up add environment variables: 
    * `TRIVIA_DB_USERNAME_PROD`
    * `TRIVIA_DB_PASSWORD_PROD`
     
    All of these parameters mentioned before can be changed by setting up enviroment variables. Accordingly: 
    * `TRIVIA_DB_HOST_PROD`, 
    * `TRIVIA_DB_PORT_PROD`, 
    * `TRIVIA_DB_NAME_PROD`

  * Initial setup

    The database itself and the user have to be created at first. Then Flask-Migration can be used to create the schema of the database. The migration script is created and available in a `migration` folder. To see details about Flask-Migrate (https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 
    
    Having the database created, to load sample data, run python script located in a file: *`backend/init_database.py`*

**2. Test enviroment**

* To be able to run tests located in file *`backend/test_flaskr.py`* the test database have to be setup. 
	The database is created before run the tests and is dropped after all tests are finished. Test data are loaded from the files: *`backend/sample_data/categories.csv`* and *`backend/sample_data/questions.csv`*. 
  To make the whole process possible a few adjustements are needed.

  * To create a database you have to setup user with privileges to database creation. The user has to be created in a database and privileges to   create database has to be granted for him. 

  * Test database configuration.

    By default, the master database (to create test database the user has to be connected to existing database, the test database does not exists in the moment) is *`postgres`*. To change it, set up the environment variable **`TRIVIA_MASTER_DATABASE_NAME`**. 
    
    To set up the username and password use enviroment variables:
     * `TRIVIA_DB_USERNAME_TEST`
     * `TRIVIA_DB_PASSWORD_TEST`
     
    The rest of the parameters by default: 
    * database name: `trivia_test`,
    * port: 5432, 
    * host: localhost. 
    
    All can be changed with setting up environment variables:
    * `TRIVIA_DB_NAME_TEST`,
    * `TRIVIA_DB_PORT_TEST`,
    * `TRIVIA_DB_HOST_TEST`.

    To run tests use comment: 
    
    ```
    python backend/test_flaskr.py
    ``` 


### Run the Server

From within the `./src` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
flask run --reload
```

The `--reload` flag will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.
